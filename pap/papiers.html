<a href="jbdenis.anto.pdf">Here is</a> the pdf of my paper list when I retired in October 2014, it is almost complete, for most of them I got the pdf.
</p>
<p>
  Before leaving Inra, I wrote some pages about the story of our research department, hoping that the task will be continued by the second author or somebody else: <a href="t277.pdf">Contribution 'a l'Histoire du D'epartement de Recherche MIA de l'INRA</a> (sorry, it is in French).
</p>
<p>
  I also described a collection of old calculators I gathered during my working period: <a href="t275.pdf">Catalogue de la Collection de Machine 'a Calculer [CMC] de l'unit'e Inra MaIAGE</a> and <a href="t276.pdf">CMC: Collection de Machine 'a Calculer de l'unit'e Inra MaIAGE</a> (also in French but with so many pictures that I hope not reading French people could find some interest in them). These two reports are common work with Ki&ecirc;n KI&Ecirc;U, a beloved and missed colleague.
