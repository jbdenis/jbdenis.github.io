<h2>
General Presentation of compta.pm
</h2>
<p><pre>
# This module was written to get rid of using
# two delphi programs I wrote in 1988 running
# under MSWindow.
#
# Not sure its subroutines can be of use for somebody else.
# Its writting was the occasion to start the 
# module /uie/.
# 
# There are three main file types used for
# the compta system.
#  [ i ] The 'definition' files where are
#        defined the different 'comptes',
#        'groupements de comptes', 'postes',
#        'groupements de postes', 'types de transaction',
#        'transactions mensuelles automatiques'.
#  [ ii] The 'montant' files where can be precised
#        initial amounts of different 'comptes'.
#  [iii] The 'transaction' files, or 'journal' files
#        where are enumerated a number of
#        elementary operations.
#  The three of them are text files and must 
#  follow some specific format which are described
#  in the "read8*" respective subroutines.
#  Also comment lines (startint with '#') are accepted
#  everywhere in these files.
