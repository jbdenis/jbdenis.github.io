<h2>
General Presentation of uie.pm
</h2>
<p><pre>
#
# 'uie' are the three vocals of the French word 'UtIlEs',
#       to remind the basic aim of the proposed subroutines.
#
# The module comprises a series of subroutines that I found of
# use to have at hand. Surely, most of them already exist
# somewhere else in a more efficient code... but it was a 
# good exercise for me.
#
# Except for 'argu', the use of arguments is somehow standardized: 
#         (i) only character chains and references
#             are used, 
#         (ii) they are given as a hash of imposed
#              keys of three characters (as 'uie'),
#         (iii) if possible, sensible default values are
#               provided,
#         (iv) as far as possible, a check is done about
#              the values which are proposed (done by
#              subroutine 'argu').
#
# Reporting errors is a major concern of programmation
# with nested calls of routines. To help a general
# strategy has been attempted with the help of an
# error object. It is a reference
# to an array whose first component contains
# the value of the constant '$uie::err_ide'; the other components
# are error messages cumulated within the nested calls.
#
# Some errors are fatal (as those raised by 'argu') but 
# much better to trace the successive calls until the
# calling script.
#
# To do so, a subroutine returns some values or
# an error object in case of error. This error
# can comprise several elementary errors.
#
# When a subroutine calls another one which returns
# an error object, it can be printed and the process
# can be stopped, but better to add a signature about
# the call and returns an error.
#
# This can be implemented with the following 
# subroutines:
# 'err9'      To detect if a scalar is a reference to an error object.
# 'add8err'   To add an error message to an error object,
#             possibly creating it.  It allows to
#             compose a multiple error within a
#             given subroutine.
# 'conca8err' To concatenate an additional error a
#             pre-existing error object, possibly 
#             creating it. Typically adding the
#             signature in a subroutine to which
#             an error is returned by a called
#             subroutine.
# 'print8err' To print the content of an error object
#             putting in light the different levels.
# 'check8err' To simultaneously call a subroutine and
#             checks its result.
#
# But the same problem arises when a script is called
# by another script, possibly with more than a level.
# To allow tracing the script calls with more or less
# details displayed on the screen, 'trace8script' has been
# devised.
