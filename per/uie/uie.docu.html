<h2>
General Presentation of uie.pm
</h2>
<p><pre>
#
# 'uie' are the three vocals of the French word 'UtIlEs',
#       to remind the basic aim of the proposed subroutines.
#
# The module comprises a series of subroutines that I found of
# use to have at hand. Surely, most of them already exist
# somewhere else in a more efficient code... but it was a 
# good exercise for me.
#
# Except for 'argu', the use of arguments is somehow standardized: 
#         (i) only character chains and references
#             are used, 
#         (ii) they are given with a hash of imposed
#              keys of three characters (as 'uie'),
#         (iii) if possible, sensible default values are
#               provided,
#         (iv) as far as possible, a check is done about
#              the values which are proposed (done by
#              subroutine 'argu').
#
# Reporting errors is a major concern of programmation
# with nested calls of routines. To help a general
# strategy has been attempted by some kind of an
# error object which is no more than a reference
# to an array whose first component contains
# the value of constant '$uie::err_ide'. Other components
# are error messages cumulated within the nested calls.
#
# It is worth distinguishing two levels:
#  - different messages within an error
#  - different errors within an error object
# 
# This can be implemented with the following 
# subroutines:
# 'error9' to detect if a scalar is an error object.
# 'add8err' to add a message to an error, possibly
#             creating it.
# 'conca8err' to concatenate an additional error a
#             pre-existing error object, possibly 
#             creating it.
# 'print8err' to print the content of an error object
#             putting in light the two levels.
#
# TO BE DONE
#   make the documentation index not with the simple
#   subroutine names but with keywords deduced from
#   the name splitting with digits.

    # title : decoding and checking arguments given through hashes
    #
    # aim : from the hash proposed by the user
    #           and the hash defining the arguments 
    #           necessary for the subroutine,
    #       checks the validity of the user proposal and
    #       returns the completed hash. The arguments
    #       are scalars, 
    #       All keys of the proposed hash (@argu) must be described
    #                into the hash referenced by $rhsub.
    #
    # input : ($sub,$rhsub,@argu)
    #         $sub is the name of the concerned subroutine
    #         $rhsub is the hash defining the arguments
    #         necessary to '$sub' by means of a reference
    #         to a small array where:
    #           [0] is the default value (undef when there is not)
    #           [1] is the type of the argument:
    #                undef for no check.
    #                'u' for 'undef' 
    #                'h' for a reference to a hash
    #                'a' for a reference to an array
    #                's' for a reference to a scalar
    #                'r' for a reference
    #                'n' for a numerical value
    #                'c' for a chain of characters
    #                or a combination of the above
    #                   when there is more than one 
    #                   possibility e.g. 'sh' for a
    #                   reference either to a scalar
    #                   or a hash
    #           [2..] the description of the argument
    #                 to be used as an help; may not exist.
    # Notice that 'undef' cannot be a default value since such
    #        a value for [0]  means that the argument must 
    #        be provided by the call.
    #        Nevertheless, it is an acceptable value when [1] 
    #        comprises 'u'.
    #
    # Be aware that quite not understandable messages can be the 
    # consequence that a hash or an array be proposed instead of a
    # reference... since values are interpreted as a hash when the
    # total number is even.
    #
    #         @arg is the array proposed by the user to be decoded
    #              or when it comprises only one pertinent element
    #                 some help is provided about the arguments
    #                 of the subroutine. More precisely when 'HELP' the
    #                 description of all arguments is displayed,
    #                 when 'help' the list of arguments is displayed,
